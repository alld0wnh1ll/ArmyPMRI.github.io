Purdue Military Research Institute Welcome Letter

Welcome Sir/Ma’am,
We are happy to have you join us here at Purdue University for your graduate education and look forward to your contributions to our community! Home of the Boilermakers, Purdue University is an internationally recognized university that enjoys high rankings for the quality of our education and research. Purdue is also notable for its welcoming atmosphere, which is particularly evident for our military members and their families. While you serve here, the Purdue Military Research Institute will form the backbone of your support network, and you can count on our faculty and staff to provide support and guidance throughout your time here. Our group of more than sixty officers that make up the PMRI cohort bring with them a varied mix of backgrounds and areas of expertise, as we host students from the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Coast Guard and Space Force.
During your time here, you may be asked to address some of the most difficult technical challenges facing our country and the national defense community. We don’t think you’d expect less…and we know you’re up to the task based on your past track record. You’ll now study with some of the world’s foremost researchers who are surrounded by other gifted students. So, eat a big breakfast, tie your shoes on tight, and bring your “A” game…Purdue academics and research will require all of that for you to succeed. But succeed you will…we enjoy a 98% success rate for on-time graduations…and have every confidence that your name will be included on that elite list.
While you are at Purdue, we also encourage you to make the most of your time outside of the lab or classroom. Boilermaker sporting events, intramural sports, and affinity clubs are varied and abundant places to connect with other campus students. In addition to our campus, the Greater Lafayette/Tippecanoe County area hosts numerous public parks, rich historical sites, and a vibrant community.
As you begin your studies, please feel comfortable reaching out to your fellow PMRI students, our PMRI faculty and staff, your academic advisors, and your civilian colleagues—they all want to see you succeed!
In this guide, you will find the institutional wisdom of those that have come before you. It is full of general advice, recommendations on things to do in the local area, and places you can look to for help when you get stuck. It is meant to help you ask the right questions as you develop a roadmap for your graduate education. Suggestions are welcome for future editions, especially if it makes the transition to Purdue a little easier for the next officer.
We wish you the best of luck as you begin your journey here at Purdue. Boiler Up!

Air Force Related Topics
Air Force Connectivity
* Webmail: https://webmail.apps.mil/mail/inbox
* VPN to AFNET: VMware Horizon Client (how-to provided on AF Portal)
* Notice: officers coming straight from a commissioning source may not have an @us.af.mil (or Space Force email). This may limit the younger officers’ ability to resolve various personnel issues that arise and may require accessing various Air Force sources (such as GAL or webmail).
o Accessing vMPF may require an email. You can try spoofing it by giving it a placeholder email for the moment and then fixing it once the account was created
Motorcycle Riding
* Motorcycle Safety training course is covered by AFIT/Safety Office.
o The course is offered in Frankfort, In (about 30-45 minutes away).
o Military riders can get resident rates (~150$).
* Cost is fully refundable.
* Timothy Thomas (timothy.thomas@afit.edu) manages the MUSST Accounts.
* Several Students have motorcycles and can be mentors in accordance with motorcycle safety program guidance.
Air Force Mentorship
* Reach out to various O-6 types for mentorship. These folks can provide great insight. Below are a few recommendations for those looking for mentors especially in the 6X community
o Col Michelle Ewy (Deputy Director AFRL-Stuff/AFOSR): PhD in chemistry, huge supporter of STEM AAD efforts, former Aide to AF Chief Scientist, Retires in 2022
o Col Jason Bartolomei (AFNWC GBSD SML/Director, he’s the guy in-charge, but the naming convention changes based on the season), PhD from MIT, really receptive and engaging
Promotion
* A Promotion Recommendation Form (PRF) should be completed by previous unit prior to your school assignment.
o If you are due for a promotion, it is on you to check and make sure your paperwork is where it needs to be.
AFIT Patches for OCPs
* https://www.reaperpatches.com/products/af-institute-of-technology?variant=35305575743655
   * There is a small number of patches locally within the AF Corps of PMRI...ask the Sr Student Fitness Testing
* Det 220 (Purdue) administers the tests, coordinate through Senior Student
* Schedule early
o Testing is historically offered prior to Fall semester following arrival of new students

* It is your responsibility for staying current / green on all personnel readiness issues
Periodic Health Assessment (See Medical Section)
   * Should be accomplished annually Signature Blocks

General Military Information
Arrival Date:
* If you already have housing secured/arranged, arriving two weeks prior to start of classes is usually sufficient to get settled. Typically, classes begin the 3rd week of August.
o You will want all this time to get your affairs in order prior to starting your classes, so take this into account when you are requesting an arrival date.
* It is a sprint until Christmas break, then you will get ~ two weeks off, then it is another sprint to summer break, then you will get ~ two weeks off...rinse and repeat
Applying for In-State Tuition/Residency
* For those on PMRI Fellowships, your offer letter asks you to apply for in-state residency once you have orders.
o Please note that this is for tuition purposes only…does not affect your legal state of
residency.
o It’s a very easy process…just follow the directions on your offer letter.
* If not on a Fellowship, go to the Purdue Registrar website and look for “Residence Classification
Information for Military Personnel” and follow the directions.
* There is a deadline for filing and failing to do this, could cause you to be responsible for the difference in costs of in-state and out of state tuition.
* Waivers for failing to submit the application on time are extremely rare!
BAH Rate (https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/bahCalc.cfm)
* $ 1,278/month, O-1, no-dependents (2024)
   * $ 1,992/month, O-3, with-dependents (2024) Car/Vehicle Registration
* Cars can be registered in Indiana as a non-resident.
* If you are a non-resident, you are exempt from various Indiana vehicle/use/wheel taxes.
o https://www.in.gov/bmv/resources/military-families/
o Tax should be around $50 to register your car.
o State Form 46402 is required, but it can be signed by Senior Student, who verifies you are in Indiana on military orders and are not a resident.
Purdue Parking
* Purdue has various parking passes, and as a grad student living more than 1.5 miles from campus, you may purchase a C pass without any restriction.
* PMRI has secured the privilege of being able to purchase A and B passes, just like faculty and staff.
o ‘A’ passes cost $250 per year (August to August)
o NOTE>>>>you can only have one kind of pass at a time…and once purchased, it’s yours for whatever time commitment you agreed to.
* Prior to the Fall and Spring semesters, PMRI leadership will reach out and ask if you’d like to purchase an upgraded parking pass. They will then send a list of those students that want the upgrades to Parking Facilities for review/approval. Approval typically happens only a few days prior to classes starting.
o While we’ve tried to accelerate that approval, we have not been successful. That said, it
truly is a privilege that we’re being given to have an A or B pass.
o Please don’t “brag” about this to your fellow grad students who are having to purchase
C passes. This privilege could easily be lost.

* Purdue is notorious for giving out parking tickets (~$70). They have a whole fleet of parking cops checking every spot on campus multiple times a day; a parking permit is very worthwhile, especially with PMRI helping us purchases employee-level permits (A & B).
* For those who need to make frequent trips to classes on campus, the A permit will allow you to park in prime locations like covered parking garages close to academic buildings (see map linked below).
* The B and C permits are the same price, but B has more locations.
* Free street parking can be found on Waldron Street, but these spots are usually taken by the fraternities and sororities. More free spots are found in the streets off campus east of the sports complex and Northwestern Ave. Sylvia St has free two-hour parking on the street and is very close to most engineering buildings.
o NOTE>>>>Moving your car to another free parking location on the same block does NOT
restart the parking clock. If you’re going to move it, move it to a different block.
* https://www.purdue.edu/campus-map/parking.html
MyPay
* https://mypay.dfas.mil/#/
o Can check paystubs and get tax documents (travel/PCS W-2s as well as annual W-2)
o Can set up allocations and contributions to TSP here.
o Can change tax withholdings (W-4 status)

TSP
* 
https://www.tsp.gov/
* 401k-like retirement account, which needs to be logged into and setup.
o Recommend investing your money in ROTH TSP
* Contributions / Allotments can be setup in MyPay.
o How your money is invested needs to be established on the TSP.gov website
o Information about funds is here:
* https://www.tsp.gov/funds-individual/
* https://www.tsp.gov/funds-lifecycle/
* Most people would do fine investing in a lifecycle fund with a target decade of your retirement
* May require you to request password and log-in information via mail

Immunization Clinic
   * May not answer phone – 937-257-3822 Local Medical Providers

Housing and Schools
General thoughts on housing:
Housing options are, generally speaking, limited even compared to the current state of the housing market. Everyone is on basically the same moving cycle: depart in Spring/Summer, arrive in Summer/Fall. Housing in West Lafayette is, generally speaking, strong due to lack of building and limited supply for 3+ room houses. Basements are hot commodities. Contracts are hard to get accepted with VA loans due to an influx of investors and cash offers being made by (usually international) competition.
* Typically avoid Lafayette inside (west) of Route 52 and north of Teal
* Suggested to avoid area near the Tate and Lyle plants…it’s stinky
* Most officers with families choose to live in West Lafayette
* Klondike area (Lindberg Village, Blackthorn neighborhood, etc. “West of 231”) (West Lafayette)
o Seems to be very family friendly, lots of families with children
o Western edge of West Lafayette
o Very commutable to the University, but much longer drive to things in Lafayette (mall,
YMCA, Churches, Sam’s Club, Home Depot, Lowes, etc.)
o Strong schools (but not considered as strong as West Lafayette Schools)
* Residential West Lafayette (north of University, circa Salisbury Rd, River Rd, Lindberg Ave, etc.,
“East of 231, South of 52”)
o Older, pricier homes
o Convenient location to grocery stores, eateries, campus, etc.
* West Lafayette (Near Harrison HS, circa Kalberer Rd, “North of 52”)
o There are some newer homes and neighborhoods
o Seem to be a little more expensive
o Anecdotally, this is where the professors live
* Battle Ground (Near Prophetstown State Park, West Lafayette address)
o Farther away from most things with older, affordable homes
o Strong schools
o Some historical museums
o The local legend states that the War of 1812 began here
* South Lafayette circa Veterans Memorial Parkway
o Seems to be family friendly
o Further from university but closer to mall, etc.
o Seems to be a growing area with newer construction
* Zillow Data
o Houses for Sale
o Houses for Rent
o Houses Sold Recently
* Apartments
o West Lafayette (Close to campus) – pay between $750-$1000/month per person depending on roommates – walk to campus buildings, restaurants/bars
* 120 Fowler Flats – New building, maybe not the best management
* Rise and The Hub – Luxury new buildings (more toward $1000+/month)
* Generally, AVOID Granite Management
* The Fairway Apartments – DO NOT LIVE HERE. Management is horrible
* Burgett Rentals (John Burgett – 765-427-1684) - Several homes in good location. John is a reasonable landlord

o West Lafayette (Away from campus) – pay between $400-$600/month per person depending on roommates – generally quieter, and larger scale (“mass production” undergraduate living). Look close to Celery Bog for walking/biking trail. Many places have busses to take you to campus.
* The Cottages
* Village West
* University Place
* The Lodge on the Trail
* Really nice complex with vast amenities
* Next to Walmart
* Lark & Alight

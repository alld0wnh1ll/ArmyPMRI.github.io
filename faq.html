                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What are the housing options?</h3>
                    <p>Answer: Off-campus housing in West Lafayette or Lafayette areas. Contact PMRI cadre for recommendations.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Informative: Many of the previous PMRI participants have purchased homes in the West Lafayette area. Much of the PMRI alumni prefer to rent to PMRI participants. Try to reach out to the current PMRI participants to see if houses or rooms are becoming available. This is a great way to save money. Sharing the rent on these houses allows PMRI students to retain some of their BAH to help with other living costs.</p>

                <p>
                    The Purdue Military Research Institute (PMRI) connects military graduate students with cutting-edge research opportunities across disciplines at Purdue University. It provides a platform for Army officers to pursue advanced degrees while maintaining their military obligations.

                <h3>What are the military obligations while in PMRI?</h3>
                <p>
                    PMRI students must maintain military standards, participate in required training, and stay within the 100-mile radius of West Lafayette unless on approved leave or pass. Regular check-ins with the PMRI cadre are required.

                <h3>How do I handle leave and passes?</h3>
                <p>
                    Leave and passes must be coordinated through your chain of command which will be the Army Student Detachment. All absences must be tracked through IPPS-A and should be planned around academic requirements. The Army Senior Officer must be informed when any leave or passes are taking place and there is a memo request for passes that must be signed by the Army PMRI Senior Officer. Please click on the Absences link to find out more.

                <h3>What housing options are available?</h3>
                <p>
                    It is important to plan housing early. All incoming officers must find housing. Plan accordingly to what your BAH is for the West Lafayette, IN area. There are some Officers who previously chose to buy their house that may have their house available for rent. It is important to reach out to the cadre early; so, they can link you up with these officers.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I find a research advisor?</h3>
                <p>
                    The PMRI program office can help connect you with faculty members whose research aligns with your interests. You should begin this process early in your application. It is important to look over the Purdue University website and find current Professors that could be potential advisors. You can reach out to Professors to see if they have ongoing projects or research interest that align with yours. Ensure that each one of your advisors is aware of your Army timeline and is willing to help you meet your objectives within this timeline. The Army rarely makes exceptions for extensions for your graduation requirements.

                <h3>What happens after graduation?</h3>
                <p>
                    Upon graduation, you will be assigned to your next duty station based on the needs of the Army. PMRI does not coordinate your follow-on assignment. The skills and credentials you acquire from PMRI will help you get more opportunities. These opportunities will be based on your own preferences and networking. For new LTs that do not have BOLC, your next duty stations will most likely be BOLC. From there, you will work with your BOLC cadre to figure out your next duty station. Do not wait until you get your orders to start planning for your next duty station.

            <h3>What about physical fitness?</h3>
            <p> 
                This is a public college environment. There are opportunities to participate in sports and fitness activities. Military gets free membership to the local YMCAs and the Purdue Rec Center is included in the tuition. Army Officers are required to take an annual ACFT and HT/WT. This will be a requirement for your Army Education Review. Purdue Army ROTC regularly puts on two ACFT events every year. We have to coordinate with their cadre to get dates, times, and slots. Purdue Army ROTC is not responsible for PMRI fellowship students; however, they have expressed in the past they will assist with facilitating ACFT events for our requirements. There are other place to get your ACFT done. We can coordinate with National Guard units, recruiting stations, and other units. It is important to coordinate early to learn when these events will take place. ACFT is a responsibility for each Officer.

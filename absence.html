<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Mileage passes are only required if your destination is more than 350 miles from your current residence at your current duty station (Purdue University - West Lafayette, IN). It is advised that you prioritize your school work first always and only travel for leisure during periods of time when appropriate (e.g. Federal Holidays or Weekends). Travel with a friend when able. This policy is subject to change by the Army Student Detachment Commander; so, ensure you check their portal for updates. </p>

<h2>Requesting an Absence</h2>
<h3> Integrated Personnel and Pay System - Army (IPPS-A) is now how the
Army handles Absence (Leave/Pass) transactions. </h3>
<ol class="step-list">
  <li>Coordinate with the <strong>Army PMRI Senior Officer</strong> to
ensure your absence will not interfere with academic requirements or
graduation timeline.</li>
  <li>Download the memo form below and have it signed by the <strong>PMRI
Senior Officer</strong> verifying that your academics will not be
negatively impacted.</li>
  <li>Log into the <strong>Student Detachment Share Portal</strong>
and identify your current <strong>Team Leader</strong> and <strong>IPPS-A
Employee ID</strong>. This may change due to PCS or personnel
transitions, so check regularly.</li>
  <li>Submit your absence request through <a href="https://ipps-a.army.mil/" target="_blank">IPPS-A Absences</a>.
Make sure to <strong>attach the signed memo</strong> to the absence
transaction.</li>
  <li>Monitor the IPPS-A Portal for updates. <strong>Your Team Leader
will not email you</strong>; they will either approve your request or
return it with required changes.</li>
  <li><em>It is your responsibility to monitor the portal and respond
to any actions required. If you are unfamiliar with the way IPPS-A
works, you can get assistance to one of the more senior Army personnel
or reach out to the Army PMRI Senior Officer.</em></li>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<div class="resource-content">
<ul>
  <li>If you know you are requesting leave that is <strong>outside of
the Continental United States (OCONUS)</strong>, please allow at least <strong>60
days of lead time</strong> to meet all Student Detachment requirements
for OCONUS travel.</li>
  <li>Leave is generally predictable in the college environment. It is
highly recommended that leave be aligned with academic breaks such as <strong>spring
break, fall break, winter break, or summer break</strong>.</li>
  <li>While Student Detachment guidelines may change, a good rule of
thumb is to provide a minimum of <strong>30 days for CONUS leave
requests</strong> and <strong>60 days for OCONUS requests</strong> for
processing by the Student Detachment cadre.</li>
<li>If you know you are requesting leave that is <strong>outside of
the Continental United States (OCONUS)</strong>, please allow at least <strong>60
days of lead time</strong> to meet all Student Detachment requirements
for OCONUS travel.</li>
<li><strong>All OCONUS (Hawaii is OCONUS) OR Foreign Travel absence
requests must include all documents that are required for the
destination country on the <a href="https://apacs.milcloud.mil/fcg/fcg.cfm" target="_blank">Electronic Foreign Clearance Guide</a>.</strong></li>
  <li>If you are planning on taking any <strong>academic-related
absence that is not Army funded</strong>, please refer to the <a href="faq.html">FAQ page</a> for information on non-funded Army
academic travel. This transaction requires approval from HRC.</li>
